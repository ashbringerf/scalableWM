----
Code for scalable watermarking and and existing re-quantisation based blind watermarking scheme are available from separate directories. The srouce files are written in JAVA and available in a form of Netbeans project. 

Source codes are available from src/ folder. 

Inidividual projects can be browsed with a starting point at main.java. 

The content adaptation parts (if exists) uses Windows executable builds for Kakadu software. Therefore these commands related to such modules are windows compatible. 

Currently PGM image and YUV video file types are supported. 

The experimental parameters are provided in separate files. Current implementation reads from these files to collect neccessary experimental. Sample files are available in a folder called paraFile / parameterFiles. 

The code was developed in a manner to run experiments in batches.
